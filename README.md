# DataStudio
DataStudio is an interactive graphical environment for software and data manipulation. Most of visualizations are built without any programming knowledge.

DataStudio is built on top of [Roassal](https://AgileVisualization.com/), an expressive library written in the [Pharo programming language](http://pharo.org).
